This is a sample blog for a client who requested a dance themed blog. I designed and created everything from scratch with no frameworks. Basic requirements for minimum viable product are blog name, blog post title, vibrant colors, and 2 fonts. Design choices Serif font was selected for the headings because dance is fancy and serif is a fancy font family, and a sans-serif font for the regular article text, because it is cleaner and easier to read. Originally, the blog title and name were an Orangy color in the client's chosen color pallet, but it got changed to a dark brown to better compliment the page and the background used. Text is purposefully wrapped around the images because it is a blog, and the background of the main content is black text on a white background to keep the article really easy to read.
